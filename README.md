# MixedReality-Development Bosed Microsoft HoloLens

The work of our team is to develop something like APP or software based on the Microsoft HoloLens machine, which is totally a MixedReality tool to achieve Vertual Reality or AR technology. Our first goal is to create a simple thing to conduct public show or something like that.😁 Great thanks to our sponsers

And the main goal of this github is to commit the script part of the project cause our facilities are not all good enough to develop it alone.😂 So we'll develop this project distributed and split it into several parts.
